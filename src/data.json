        "My name is Maximilian and I'm 28 years old. Late but hopefully not too late I discovered my passion for programming.",
        "After my studies in Marketing & Sales I was putting myself more and more into the world of IT. After the first lines of code in Python and a lot of initial struggling I build more and more enthusiasm for coding.",
        "I'm interested in topics like Web-Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), Web-Scraping, App-Development (Flutter), Machine Learning, Linux and other things. My future dream is to become a professional software developer.",
        "Beside coding and all the interesting IT topics I like to stay outside, play sqaush, deeptalk and cook some good southtyrolean Knödel."
