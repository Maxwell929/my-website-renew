              <p>My name is Maximilian and I'm 28 years old. Late but hopefully not too late I discovered my passion for programming. </p>
              <p>After my studies in Marketing & Sales I was putting myself more and more into the world of IT. After the first lines of code in Python and a lot of initial struggling I build more and more enthusiasm for coding.</p>
              <p>I'm interested in topics like Web-Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Gatsby), Web-Scraping, App-Development (Flutter), Linux and other things. My future dream is to become a professional software developer.</p>
              <p>Beside coding and all the interesting IT topics I like to stay outside, play sqaush, deeptalk and cook some good southtyrolean Kn√∂del.</p>
